    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), `self` is used as a reference to the current instance of a class. It allows objects to access their own attributes and methods within the class definition. The use of `self` is essential for maintaining object state, enabling instance-specific behavior, and ensuring proper interaction between objects and their methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key reasons why `self` is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accessing Instance Variables**: `self` is used to access and modify instance variables (attributes) of an object. It distinguishes between the instance variables of one object and another, allowing each object to maintain its own state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calling Object Methods**: `self` is used to call other methods of the same class from within a method. When a method is invoked on an object, `self` implicitly passes the object itself to the method, allowing it to manipulate the object's data or call its other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initializing Instance Variables**: In the `__init__()` method, `self` is used to initialize instance variables. It binds the attributes to the object when it is created, ensuring that each object has its own set of attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maintaining Object Identity**: `self` helps in maintaining the identity of an object by providing a reference to itself. This ensures that operations performed on one object do not affect other objects of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Enabling Polymorphism and Inheritance**: `self` plays a crucial role in implementing polymorphism and inheritance. It allows methods to be overridden in subclasses and ensures that the correct method is called based on the object's type at runtime.\n",
